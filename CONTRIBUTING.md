This open-source package is offered to the community as is.
The authors are working to add new functionalities and to improve the existing ones.
The GitLab repository contains the most updated version.

The users can contribute by:
1. identifying bugs;
2. proposing different options that better suit their specific needs;
3. providing new information, such as aditional modules for other instruments/observatories
4. any other propositions.

Currently there are two ways to communicate with the authors:
1. opening issues in the GitLab repository;
2. sending an e-mail to bouwman@mpia.de.

The answers to some of the issues raised from users will be added to a FAQ section.
