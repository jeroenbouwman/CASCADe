:blue:`CASCADe` Environment
===========================

:blue:`CASCADe` uses the following environment variables::

    CASCADE_STORAGE_PATH
      Default path to all functional data needed by the CASCADe
      package.
    CASCADE_DATA_PATH
      Default path to all observational data to be analyzed with
      CASCADe.
    CASCADE_SAVE_PATH
      Default path to where CASCADe saves all pipeline output.
    CASCADE_INITIALIZATION_FILE_PATH:
      Default path to CASCADe pipeline initialization files.
    CASCADE_SCRIPTS_PATH
      Default path to the CASCADe data reduction pipeline scripts
      for each observation.
    CASCADE_LOG_PATH:
      Default path to the saved CASCADe log files.
    CASCADE_WARNINGS
      Switch to show or not show warnings. Can either be 'on'
      or 'off'.

These environment variables control where :blue:`CASCADe` searches and stores all
required data. In case the environment variables are not set by the user,
:blue:`CASCADe` uses default values defined in the `initialize` module. The main
environment variable is ``CASCADE_STORAGE_PATH``. This environment variable,
if not set by the user has a default value of
**<user_home_directory>/CASCADeSTORAGE/**. All other path settings stored in the
other environment variables are set relative to this, so in principle does the user
only need to set the ``CASCADE_STORAGE_PATH`` variable to the preferred location,
such as a directory on a larger file system rather then in the user home directory.
The ``CASCADE_DATA_PATH``, ``CASCADE_SAVE_PATH``,
``CASCADE_INITIALIZATION_FILE_PATH``, ``CASCADE_SCRIPTS_PATH`` and
``CASCADE_LOG_PATH`` are set by default to **data/, results/, init_files/,
scripts/ and logs/**, respectively, all relative to the path defined by
``CASCADE_STORAGE_PATH``. The ``CASCADE_WARNINGS`` variable is by default set
to **"on"** to show possible warnings generated by the :blue:`CASCADe` code.

Setting environment Variables
-----------------------------

To set an environment veriable you can use the following shell commands on Linux
or MAC OS:

.. code-block:: console

   export CASCADE_WARNINGS=off

Or in a Windows environment:

.. code-block:: console

   set CASCADE_WARNINGS=off

Alternatively one could set the environment variables in a python script before
importing :blue:`CASCADe`:

.. code-block:: python

   import os
   os.environ['CASCADE_WARNINGS']='off'

   import cascade

.. warning::
  Note that in the latter case the environment varables **MUST** be defined before
  importing cascade.
